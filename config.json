    "more": "This network is showing clusters of related subjects of research at Michigan State University. Whenever someone submits their dissertation, they choose a handful of subjects that describe their dissertation. These subjects come from a predefined list.<br /><br />The edge weights in this network are defined by how often the subjects co-occur on a thesis. So if 10 theses both have \"Ecology\" and \"Computer Science\" as subjects, the edge weight between \"Ecology\" and \"Computer Science\" is 10. The stronger an edge weight is between two subjects, the more they are considered closely related in this graph.<br /><br />Data was provided by Devin Higgins from Michigan State University. The code and data for this project are available on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/rhiever/dissertation-topic-network\">https://github.com/rhiever/dissertation-topic-network</a><br /><br />If you would like to visualize similar data from your own university, please <a href=\"http://www.randalolson.com/contact/\">contact Randy Olson</a> to discuss collaboration.",
